Automatic Testing Pipeline for MERN Application
📘 Overview

Automatic Testing Pipeline for MERN Application is a full-stack web project designed to demonstrate how automated testing can be seamlessly integrated into a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) architecture. The system showcases how frontend and backend components of a web application can be connected through RESTful APIs and how testing can be automated to ensure reliable deployment and continuous validation during development.

This project was developed as part of the B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering (Hons.) in AIML program at Chandigarh University, under the guidance of Mr. Jagjit Singh Masoun, Assistant Professor, Department of AIT-CSE.

⚙️ Key Features

Automated Testing Integration: Implements automated testing tools (like Jest or Mocha) to validate backend logic and ensure code reliability.

MERN Architecture: Uses React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

Seamless Communication: RESTful APIs enable efficient communication between client and server.

Scalable and Modular Design: Each module is independently testable and scalable for production environments.

Frontend Dashboards: Provides intuitive interfaces for login, reports, and test summaries.

💻 System Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture where:

The React frontend handles the user interface and communicates with the backend using REST APIs.

The Node.js/Express backend manages routing, APIs, and server logic.

The MongoDB database stores and retrieves testing data, logs, and user information.

This architecture ensures smooth data flow, scalability, and maintainability.

🧩 Module Description
Frontend Module

Built using React.js for responsive and dynamic UI.

Performs CRUD operations through backend API calls.

Includes components for user authentication, dashboard, and report visualization.

Backend Module

Developed using Node.js and Express.js.

Manages APIs, routing, and data processing.

Integrates automated testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha for backend validation.

🖥️ Frontend Screens

Home Page: Provides access to different modules.

Login/Signup Pages: Manage user authentication securely.

Reports Page: Displays automated testing outcomes and logs of passed/failed test cases.

📊 Output and Reports

The system generates detailed test reports after each automated test cycle. Reports include:

Status dashboards

Test case summaries

Logs of successful and failed executions

⚠️ Limitations

Limited scalability without continuous integration (CI/CD) integration.

Lacks an advanced analytics dashboard for deeper visualization of test metrics.

🚀 Future Scope

Integrate continuous deployment using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Add visual performance dashboards for better monitoring and analysis.

Incorporate AI-based test case generation to enhance coverage and reduce manual effort.
